    "### **Qualitative Analysis of Model Responses**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of four models—Base LLM, Basic RAG, Advanced Agentic RAG (Base), and Advanced Agentic RAG (Fine-Tuned)—shows a clear improvement in accuracy and response quality as the models progress from a standard LLM to a fine-tuned agentic RAG. Below is a qualitative assessment of how the responses evolve across models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Base LLM**  \n",
    "- **Observations:** The Base LLM struggles with factual accuracy, selecting incorrect options despite being presented with multiple-choice answers.  \n",
    "- **Limitations:** Without retrieval capabilities, it relies solely on pre-trained knowledge, leading to inconsistencies in responses. The lack of real-time information retrieval also results in hallucinations and misinterpretations.  \n",
    "- **Example Issue:** In one instance, it incorrectly identified \"Lags during checkout\" as the most common Blinkit app issue, diverging from the retrieved evidence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Basic RAG**  \n",
    "- **Observations:** Basic RAG significantly improves factual correctness by integrating retrieved documents into response generation. It correctly identifies key issues like \"Worst customer service\" for Blinkit and \"Orders get canceled\" for Jiomart.  \n",
    "- **Improvements Over Base LLM:**  \n",
    "  - Retrieval reduces hallucinations.  \n",
    "  - More contextually relevant responses.  \n",
    "- **Limitations:**  \n",
    "  - Despite retrieval, responses remain surface-level, offering minimal explanation or synthesis beyond the raw document content.  \n",
    "  - Lack of deeper reasoning or contextualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Advanced Agentic RAG (Base)**  \n",
    "- **Observations:** The base version of the advanced agentic RAG enhances coherence and response depth. It not only selects the correct answer but also provides a structured reasoning process, integrating insights from multiple retrieved documents.  \n",
    "- **Improvements Over Basic RAG:**  \n",
    "  - More structured responses with explanations.  \n",
    "  - Some degree of reasoning beyond simple retrieval.  \n",
    "  - Higher confidence in selecting the correct answer.  \n",
    "- **Limitations:**  \n",
    "  - While the explanations are better, they are still somewhat rigid and template-like.  \n",
    "  - Lacks a deeper understanding of conflicting information when present.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Advanced Agentic RAG (Fine-Tuned)**  \n",
    "- **Observations:** The fine-tuned version of the agentic RAG exhibits the most refined responses. It provides nuanced explanations, synthesizing information from multiple sources rather than merely echoing retrieved content.  \n",
    "- **Key Strengths Over the Base Model:**  \n",
    "  - Better structured responses with logical flow.  \n",
    "  - Improved ability to filter redundant or misleading information.  \n",
    "  - Increased coherence and natural phrasing.  \n",
    "  - More refined argumentation, offering insights rather than just factual retrieval.  \n",
    "- **Example Improvement:** When discussing Blinkit's customer service, it not only identifies poor support but also contextualizes user frustration with specific pain points like \"opportunistic mindset\" and \"lack of response.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overall Discussion: Evolution of Response Quality**  \n",
    "1. **Accuracy:** The models move from incorrect/random responses (Base LLM) to near-perfect accuracy (Fine-Tuned RAG).  \n",
    "2. **Retrieval Integration:** Basic RAG ensures that responses are grounded in retrieved documents, reducing hallucinations.  \n",
    "3. **Contextual Depth:** Advanced Agentic RAG introduces structured reasoning, and its fine-tuned version adds interpretative analysis.  \n",
    "4. **Response Coherence:** The fine-tuned RAG delivers the most human-like, structured responses, demonstrating the highest level of intelligence in synthesis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Verdict**  \n",
    "The transition from Base LLM to Advanced Agentic RAG (Fine-Tuned) represents a clear trajectory of improvement in factual correctness, depth, coherence, and overall reliability. While Basic RAG ensures correctness, fine-tuning enables nuanced, contextualized explanations, making responses more useful for real-world applications."
